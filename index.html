    <h2>The Hidden Dangers in Your Digital Routine</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>88%</strong> of data breaches are caused by human error. – IBM</li>

    <h2>What’s at Stake: The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p>Cybercrime is expected to cost the world <strong>$10.5 trillion annually by 2025</strong> – making it more profitable than the global drug trade. Your personal info—emails, passwords, browsing history—is currency for criminals.</p>
    <p>Even your digital identity could be sold on the dark web for as little as <strong>$6</strong>. But cleaning up the mess after identity theft? That can cost <strong>months</strong> of recovery, lost opportunities, and emotional distress.</p>
